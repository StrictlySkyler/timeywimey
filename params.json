During those sometimes, we also sometimes need to update the data which will power that task.  (Animations, for example.)  As such, we want to be able to execute the task, but *only* after we have the most up to date data.\r\n\r\nOr, if it's an expensive task, we only want to do it when we think the JS engine isn't in the middle of anything, and the user isn't doing anything we'd cause to hang.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we need a scheduler with a li'l bit of brains in it.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
